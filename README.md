## 📽️ The Development Process
The first step was to understand the concept of Next.js, where server and client work together, which is a bit more complex compared to the basic MERN stack with separate server and client. Once I got the hang of this concept, I started planning the project architecture, determining which pages, server routes, and additional features I needed. For the database, I used a free dataset from Kaggle to display the books.

On the frontend, pages were divided into components, and each component was broken down into smaller parts. In some parts of the app, I used props to pass data between components, while in others I used Context API. The frontend was built with React + TypeScript, and the backend was written with TypeScript as well. Tailwind CSS was used for styling.

## 🧠 What I Learned
